Diet Rater Project

This is my first Rails project. The goal of the application is for users to be able to evaluate their diet for micronutrient completeness. 

A demo of this project can be seen here https://radiant-spire-1962.herokuapp.com/

Main Features

1. Most current USDA database of foods with their corresponding nutritional analysis.
2. Track a list of foods eaten in a day
3. Charts to display relative completeness of nutritional intake.
